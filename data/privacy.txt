Almost everything people do online is tracked by a variety of entities, whether they are
shopping, using a search engine, reading the news, getting health information, or even
watching pornography. One regulatory model for protecting people’s privacy from all this
tracking, and currently the dominant legal framework in the United States, is known as
‘notice-and-consent’. Under notice-and-consent, people are mostly free to collect and
use data as they wish, but they are required to notify users of their data policies, typically
by including a link to a privacy policy. Users are then taken to consent to these, either
expressly (by clicking ‘I agree’ or some cognate) or tacitly (by merely using the services).
According to advocates, notice-and-consent provides all the privacy protections people
need; notice empowers users to decide for themselves whether data practices are reason-
able, and their consent legitimates these practices. Critics have objected on several
grounds. Daniel Susser offers a nice summary:
Philosophers and legal theorists argue that the cost of opting out of services is
often too high to represent a meaningful choice for individuals to make. In cases
where they might reasonably opt out individuals are frequently ill-equipped to
fully understand the decision they face. And even when they do understand it,
what is at issue in the decision is often a social rather than individual interest.
In such cases individuals should not be deciding about it in the first place. 1
The upshot of these criticisms, Susser proposes, is that ‘the consent offered when individ-
uals sign privacy policies ... is not meaningful’ and ‘cannot legitimate the collection and
use of user information’. 2 Susser thus joins a growing chorus of scholars who propose that
consent to data practices is ‘meaningless’. 3 Importantly, critics typically claim that these
problems arise from structural and technical features of data practices that are either

impossible or extremely unlikely to change, and that as a result, ‘Notice-and-consent
appears to be a failed regulatory model’. 4
Against all this, I argue that advocates and critics of notice-and-consent are both mis-
taken about the significance of consent to data practices. Advocates are wrong to think
that consent guarantees legitimacy, for reasons critics have rightly emphasized. But critics
are wrong to think that consent ‘is not meaningful’ and ‘cannot legitimate’ data practices;
while consent does not guarantee legitimacy, it may legitimate all the same. The basic rea-
son is that if notice were improved, consent would neither be so impoverished as to be
meaningless nor so impeccable as to guarantee legitimacy; it could legitimate data prac-
tices that are independently reasonable but not those that are exploitative.
The major upshot is that people often can provide meaningful consent to data
practices – even complicated data practices that are costly to avoid. This does not mean
that notice-and-consent is a good regulatory model; even if people can provide meaning-
ful consent to data practices, it may often be preferable to spare them the burdens of doing
so (and/or to strengthen their bargaining positions by denying them the ability to do so). 5
But it does mean that invasive data practices (i.e. data practices which would conflict with
an individual’s rights) can, in the right circumstances, be legitimated by consent. This
in turn means that where there are (on balance) genuinely good reasons to deploy such
data practices, this can be done in good conscience, as long as consent is properly secured
and care is taken to not exploit data subjects.
1. Framing the Debate
The function of consent is to voluntarily alter moral and/or legal (henceforth: ‘normative’)
entitlements. For our purposes, this chiefly involves waiving some of our rights (thus
releasing certain others from any correlative duties) and/or undertaking obligations (either
to the performance or nonperformance of certain actions). Our ability to alter normative
entitlements is, of course, not unlimited; I typically cannot waive your rights, for example.
Where somebody’s consent can alter some normative entitlement (when expressed
through suitable means, which can vary between contexts), I will say that they have a nor-
mative power. One’s normative powers thus demarcate a space within which one can con-
trol rights and duties, sometimes one’s own, sometimes other people’s. 6 Call consent that
does (morally) or should (legally) alter entitlements in the ways it purports to ‘valid’.
In the present context, the relevant function of consent is rendering permissible certain
data practices which would otherwise be impermissible. Structurally, this is best under-
stood as involving two components. First, data practitioners (people who engage in data
practices) initially have duties, owed to technology users, to refrain from certain data prac-
tices (equivalently: users have rights, held against data practitioners, to be free from cer-
tain data practices). 7 Second, users have powers to waive these duties, thus permitting
(ceteris paribus) data practitioners to do something they would otherwise not be permitted
to do. It is only when (and because) there is this distribution of duties and powers that user
consent to data practices is significant; where there are no initial duties to refrain from data
practices, user consent is unnecessary, and where users lack the powers to waive such
duties, user consent is irrelevant.
It will be helpful to have a label in what follows, so I will call any duty prohibiting a data
practice a ‘data restriction’. The question of the proper role for user consent to data

practices is fundamentally about whether and when users should be able to waive data
restrictions (versus when, perhaps for the protection of users themselves, certain data
restrictions should be unwaivable). This breaks down into two sub-questions:
POWERS: Which data restrictions should users have the legal powers to waive?
CONDITIONS: When should users be recognized as exercising these powers?
It is worth emphasizing that CONDITIONS is distinct from POWERS; there is
sometimes a temptation to speak only of ‘consent’ in the abstract, but we can, should,
and do adopt different standards for the conditions under which different powers are
exercised (for example, legally binding contracts have various formal requirements, and
we have uncommonly strict requirements for consent to medical research).
Much of the theoretical work on consent to data practices has been done in the context
of criticizing notice-and-consent, which offers particularly promiscuous answers to these
questions; notice-and-consent grants users nearly unlimited powers to legitimate data
practices and places almost no restrictions on the conditions under which these powers
can be exercised. Two standard criticisms have emerged. The first claims that user con-
sent is typically ‘meaningless’, as users are uninformed (they cannot reasonably be
expected to understand what they are consenting to) and their consent is involuntary (they
typically have ‘no choice’ but to consent even if they do). Structurally, this challenges
notice-and-consent’s answer to CONDITIONS. That said, critics typically argue that
these problems cannot realistically be addressed and use this to challenge notice-and-con-
sent’s answer to POWERS, arguing for a variety of data restrictions users are not empow-
ered to waive.
The technical details of these arguments are typically made much more explicit than the
normative ones. To establish that user consent is involuntary, critics note that invasive
data practices are so pervasively tied to important technologies (e.g. the internet) that
avoiding them essentially requires forgoing these technologies altogether, something
thought so unrealistic as to invalidate any consent offered to bundled data practices. 8
To establish that users are uninformed, critics cite a variety of features that allegedly make
‘informed consent’ to data practices difficult or impossible, including: (i) the length and
complexity of privacy agreements, both as they actually are, and as they allegedly must
be in order to adequately inform users; 9 (ii) the sheer volume of privacy agreements users
encounter; 10 (iii) the ability of data practitioners to unilaterally update privacy agreements
at any time, thus requiring constant monitoring from users; 11 (iv) the fact that the infer-
ences that can be drawn from data, and thus the costs of giving up this data, can be highly
counterintuitive; 12 (v) the frequency with which data flows to third parties (e.g. is sold on
data markets), which often makes it all but impossible to assess who will ultimately gain
access to one’s data and what they will do with it; 13 and (vi) the aggregative nature of data
costs (new data can combine with old data in complicated ways to facilitate even more
counterintuitive inferences). 14 All told, or so the argument goes, assessing the costs of
data practices is so difficult that most users cannot offer ‘meaningful’ consent to them.
We can summarize the first criticism as arguing that user consent is defective. The sec-
ond criticism argues that user consent is, in many cases, irrelevant. In granting users
nearly unlimited powers to legitimate data practices, notice-and-consent presupposes that
data restrictions are owed almost exclusively to individual users, but critics reject this. The
standard argument is that many data restrictions are justified by broad social

Consent and the Right to Privacy 3
considerations (for example: because data is being used to manipulate people in ways that
undermine democracy, and this must be stopped). That said, we need not appeal to broad
social values to make this point; if there is any justification for data restrictions other than
the protection of the individual user whose data is at issue (including e.g. the protection of
groups smaller than society generally, such as marginalized groups who may be discrimi-
nated against), notice-and-consent’s answer to POWERS fails, since users should not
have powers to waive duties that are not owed to them.
While these criticisms are surely on to something, I believe they are less forceful than is
standardly believed; they rightly highlight various respects in which notice-and-consent
may leave people vulnerable to unscrupulous data practitioners, but they are unreasonably
pessimistic about what consent can accomplish when data practices are scrupulously
deployed in good faith (including, perhaps, when doing so is enforced by market condi-
tions rather than legislation). Let us consider each criticism in more detail.
2. Information
Let us start with the first criticism, which argues that consent under notice-and-consent is
typically invalid since: (i) users cannot reasonably be expected to understand what they are
consenting to; and (ii) they typically have ‘no choice’ but to consent even if they do. As
Alan Wertheimer’s work in particular has demonstrated, these arguments are consider-
ably more complicated than is sometimes appreciated. 15 I will start with information.
Conventional wisdom has it that valid consent either should or must be ‘informed’. It is
not always clear exactly what this means, but on a fairly standard analysis, it requires
knowing all the following (to some suitable level of depth):16
(1) what is being consented to;
(2) the likely costs and benefits of consenting;
(3) the details of any relevant alternative courses of action.
The standard argument for this sort of view appeals to autonomy (or to a close legal cor-
relate, ‘the right to self-determination’). 17 For example, Faden and Beauchamp argue
that autonomy ought to serve as ‘the benchmark’ by which consent is evaluated and that
‘An action cannot be autonomous if the actor fails to have an understanding of his or
her action’. 18 Similarly, Barocas and Nissenbaum propose that ‘There is little value in a
protocol for informed consent that does not meaningfully model choice and, in turn,
autonomy’, something that requires people to ‘understand how their assent plays out in
terms of specific commitments, beliefs, needs, goals, and desires’. 19 The core idea seems
to involve three claims: first, that the purpose of soliciting consent (the only purpose?) is to
facilitate autonomous decision-making; second, that autonomous decisions must be
appropriately responsive to an agent’s values; and third, that this requires the agent to
be informed in roughly the previous sense.
There is surely much to recommend this proposal, but it belies a great deal of complex-
ity. To start, we should distinguish two possible claims: first, that valid consent must be
informed, and anything insufficiently informed is thus, by that fact alone, not valid con-
sent; second, that valid consent should ideally be informed, but in ways that might be out-
weighed by other considerations. Let us consider each option in turn.

To help explore the proposal that valid consent must be informed, consider the follow-
ing example:
CULPABLE IGNORANCE: Culpable wants to rent an apartment and is given a
lease. She could easily read and understand the lease, but chooses not to, because
she prefers to watch television. Culpable signs and returns the lease the next day,
falsely claiming that she has read it and agrees to the terms. Landlord stops show-
ing the apartment to other prospective tenants, believing a tenancy agreement
has been formed.
Culpable is significantly uninformed about the lease she has signed but has nobody to
blame but herself. Assuming the terms are reasonable, she should be held to them, even
if she did not know about them, and even if she would not have signed if she had. For
example, imagine the lease prohibits pets, whereas Culpable was planning to purchase a
cat. It is unfortunate that she is now bound by this prohibition, but that is her burden to
bear; to treat her consent as invalid would be unfair to Landlord. 20
To prevent misunderstandings, the lesson of CULPABLE IGNORANCE is not that
users should be held responsible for failing to understand privacy agreements (a naïve pro-
posal at best, a malicious one at worst). 21 The lesson is that if there is some sense in which
valid consent must be informed, this involves informational requirements far lower than
those standardly associated with ‘informed consent’. Culpable does not know exactly
which entitlements her consent is altering. If you add my addendum about pets, she also
does not know about an important cost of consenting. And while this was not part of the
example, she could easily know very little about the available alternatives, e.g. because this
was the only apartment she looked into. None of this invalidates her consent.
In this example, the most important reason to treat Culpable’s consent as valid is that
this is a bilateral consent transaction, and fairness to the other party requires doing
so. It is worth emphasizing that this is not the only sort of case. Consider another example,
this time involving marriage (which transforms normative entitlements in various impor-
tant ways, e.g. pertaining to property, decision-making powers in the event of incapacita-
tion, the fiduciary obligations that come with these, etc.) 22 :
OPTIMISTIC MARRIAGE: Optimist and Idealist are in love and decide to get
married. They know that many marriages end in divorce; however, they are all
but certain this will not happen to them, as their love is true love.
While some people in this (probably not uncommon) situation might be justified in their
confidence, many presumably would not be. Assume Optimist and Idealist are not –
assume their confidence is not premised on some deep insight into their relationship
but is simply a by-product of their intoxicating love. This makes their decision to get mar-
ried not just uninformed, but significantly misinformed, as they have false beliefs about
the probabilities of various costs and benefits the decision implicates. Even still, I propose,
their consent is and should be treated as valid; we should neither prevent them from mar-
rying, nor, if their marriage fails, retroactively declare their marriage null and void on the
grounds that it resulted from faulty consent.
To be clear, I do not take any of this to refute the proposal that valid consent must be
informed in some important but more minimal sense. Grounds for doubt
notwithstanding, 23 I find this extremely plausible, for reasons Tom Dougherty nicely
articulates: consent must typically be intentional, and one must have at least some

Consent and the Right to Privacy 5
understanding of what one is doing for an action to be intentional. 24 What is important for
my purposes is that if this is true at all, these requirements fall far short of the standard
requirements for ‘informed consent’; they may include various details about what is con-
sented to, but will not, at least in general, include a deep understanding of costs and ben-
efits or available alternatives.
I turn now to the second proposal: that valid consent should ideally be informed, but
only as one consideration amongst others. Perhaps this is correct – either because of some
deep truth about autonomy and consent, or simply because being informed makes people
more likely to exercise their powers in ways that promote their welfare. The important
thing to recognize is that there are considerations that pull in the opposite direction. We
are limited beings living in complex environments, and there are many reasons why we
may not wish or be able to thoroughly inform ourselves about various consent decisions.
When such circumstances arise, strict information requirements can deny us the power of
choice entirely, or at least make this power very difficult to exercise. While this is surely
sometimes appropriate, it often has serious costs; denying people the power of choice
either means denying them certain opportunities, which is problematic when these oppor-
tunities are valuable, or forcing these opportunities upon people, which is problematic
when their desirability or legitimacy depends on people’s consent. Given these costs, it
is sometimes better to grant people the power of choice even where a decision involves
serious information deficits.
Consider marriage again. Marriage is a serious legal arrangement with serious legal
repercussions, yet decisions to get married often involve significant information deficits;
the costs and benefits are uncertain, the probabilities are difficult to assess, the alternatives
are massively unknown and poorly explored, and the decision implicates powerful emo-
tions that are known to distort our judgment. Why do we let people enter into such a seri-
ous legal arrangement with such impoverished information (and not just let them, but
even incentivize doing so with various legal benefits)? I propose that the best justification
at least includes the following: because we think marriage is an important and valuable
institution, for the married couple and/or for society generally. If it were not (or, I sup-
pose, if you think it is not), it might well be preferable to deny people the power to marry
on grounds of protecting them from bad decisions resulting from weak information.
For another example, consider medical research, which inevitably involves significant
information deficits and sometimes subjects participants to serious risks. It is hard to jus-
tify allowing participants to consent to this except by appealing to the value of medical
research, and indeed, our regulatory structures presuppose this (institutional review
boards are tasked with assessing whether a study’s potential benefits justify its risks to par-
ticipants and will typically prohibit the recruitment of human subjects for risky studies that
lack ‘social value and scientific validity’). 25 Importantly, the value facilitated by medical
research is not, or is not only, to the benefit of participants; one of the crucial justifications
for allowing people to consent to risky studies despite serious information deficits is that
this facilitates something of great importance to society generally. And, or so I would urge,
this justification succeeds. As these information deficits cannot be eliminated (although
we do the best we can), and as it would (I assume) typically be illegitimate to force people
to participate in medical research, the value of medical research justifies lower information
requirements for consent than might apply in other contexts.
My proposal, then (Wertheimer’s proposal, really), is that there are no context-
insensitive information requirements for valid consent, except perhaps of a quite minimal

sort; the threshold of information beneath which people should be denied some power, or
prevented from exercising it, depends on factors that are specific to the power in question.
One factor is the comparative importance of protecting people from bad decisions versus
facilitating good ones, something that depends on the stakes of the decision. Another per-
tains to the viability of bypassing consent altogether, i.e. whether it is possible, legitimate,
and desirable to deny people some power and promote the values consent might otherwise
facilitate through other means. This is impossible for values that constitutively depend on
consent. It is illegitimate where it violates people’s (moral) rights, either to have certain
legal powers or to be free from certain non-consensual interactions. And it is undesirable
where the values at stake would be more effectively promoted consensually, whether
because people prefer to make decisions themselves, because their decisions track their
preferences better than alternatives, or for some other reason. 26
Consider now consent to data practices. I grant that there are various technical and
structural features of data practices that significantly limit people’s abilities to assess the
costs of consenting to them. If we add the plausible assumption that these costs can be sig-
nificant (if only because people value their privacy, although perhaps also in more tangible
ways), this makes a strong case for declaring such consent invalid on grounds of protec-
tion. But this is, as argued, only one part of the story; we must also consider the values con-
sent to data practices potentially facilitates and the viability of bypassing consent
altogether. I will consider these in reverse order.
Note first that users can be informed about data practices in various important ways
(or at least presumably could be, if data practitioners honestly and accessibly summarized
them). Most notably, they can often understand what data is being collected, certain
salient features about how it is used, and who initially collects it (or embeds services that
allow others to collect it). Each of these is extremely significant – they are some of the most
significant features of many data practices. For example, many in-home assistants exten-
sively record audio after an activation command is spoken (or is mistakenly flagged as spo-
ken), and workers are sometimes employed to listen to this audio to improve voice
recognition algorithms. 27 Many people find this extremely invasive, and not because of
complex technical details they cannot be expected to understand; the recording itself is
invasive, as is allowing people to listen to it. That said, there are good reasons for this prac-
tice (improving voice recognition algorithms is important), and many people seem
untroubled by it, or at least willing to tolerate it in exchange for the benefits offered by
the technology. Given this, I see no reason (at least based on concerns about information)
why consent cannot legitimate these specific practices, following suitable disclosures.
Moreover, I would urge that consent both should and must be solicited here; should,
because it will help track people’s preferences about whether they are subjected to these
practices, and must, because it simply strikes me as illegitimate to extensively record audio
inside of people’s homes without their consent (I cannot develop a proper argument for
this claim here, but I hope your good moral judgment suffices; this is clearly a practice that
otherwise conflicts with the right to privacy, and that must thus be consented to if it is to be
legitimate).
This is a fairly extreme case, but it is not a unique case. Do I want to use a search engine
that indefinitely retains my search queries? Or map software that indefinitely retains my
location data? Or a website with analytics software that produces (or can produce) recon-
structed videos of my web browsing? Or cloud storage that searches through the contents
of my photographs? Or an email provider that builds a profile on me by searching through

Consent and the Right to Privacy 7
my emails? Or a social media platform, which extensively collects and uses data, run by a
company with a dubious ethical history? I could go on, but I hope the point is already suf-
ficiently clear: people can track many salient features, both of data practices and of those
who engage in them, and often have strong and reasonable preferences because of this. At
least if we restrict our attention to information, their consent to such practices is not at all
‘meaningless’; people know enough, or can know enough, to bring meaningful and
important preferences to bear on whether to use such technologies. Moreover, I would
urge again that many of these practices must be consented to if they are to be legitimate.
I thus propose that it would be undesirable, and often illegitimate, to permit these data
practices without user consent. Should they be permitted at all? There is a strong case to
be made that many of them should; data is extremely valuable, and users derive both tech-
nological and economic benefits from data practices (both as individuals and as members
of our society). Perhaps most obviously, data is one of the twin economic pillars of
the internet that make so much content available for ‘free’ (the other is advertising,
although it is somewhat misleading to separate these). To offer an example I find particu-
larly striking, one can find instructional videos online, many of them quite high quality,
covering almost any topic one might reasonably want instruction on (e.g. yoga, cooking,
fixing your car, assembling your own computer, or even coaching Little League baseball).
This knowledge is made available to everybody with an internet connection and is signif-
icantly monetized – both in distribution and often in production – by data practices. One
argument in favor of permitting these data practices is that there is value in being able to
pay for content with data instead of money, but it goes deeper than this. For one thing,
it is at least unclear whether content would flourish to the extent it currently does under
alternative economic models. For another, there is an important social-justice function
served here, as the egalitarian distribution of specialized knowledge is no small matter.
And this is to say nothing of the respects in which our technology itself is improved by data
practices.
I am going to take a step back, as I cannot properly explore the considerations that count
for and against various data practices in this article (to say nothing of the viability of alter-
native economic models). My fundamental proposal, however, is that this is the task that
faces us. People have rights, most notably the right to privacy, and data practices some-
times conflict with these rights. Where they so conflict, these practices must be consented
to if they are to be legitimate (the rights-holders must waive the rights in question). If peo-
ple could not, in principle, offer valid consent here, they would either have to be denied
certain rights, various data practices would inevitably be illegitimate, or both. But at least
from the perspective of information, this need not be the case: first, because users can be
informed about some very important features of data practices; second, because the
requirements for valid consent depend on the comparative importance of protecting peo-
ple from bad decisions versus facilitating good ones (whether good for the consenter, soci-
ety generally, or both); and third, because invasive data practices sometimes have
considerable value. Where there are good reasons to deploy certain data practices (eco-
nomic, technological, or otherwise), where these reasons trump or outweigh countervail-
ing reasons, and where sincere efforts are made to inform data subjects in whatever
relevant ways are feasible, people can thus offer valid consent to data practices despite sig-
nificant information deficits.
Of course, we must be careful here; insofar as people have weak information, they are
poorly positioned to safeguard their interests, and vulnerable to exploitation. If we are

to accept their consent, it is morally imperative that their interests are somehow protected
elsewhere – either by scrupulous data practitioners, a well-ordered market, regulators, or
some combination of the above. But as long as they are properly protected, consent can
legitimize practices that are otherwise illegitimate, and such practices can thus be
deployed in good conscience (at least from the perspective of information). Whether
and when data practices satisfy these requirements depends on difficult questions about
their empirical effects, the right to privacy, distributive justice, and other matters. As this
article is primarily on consent, I must set such issues aside.
3. ‘No Choice’ Scenarios
Let us now explore the claim that consent under notice-and-consent is often invalid
because users have ‘no choice’ but to provide it. I will note in passing that the meaning
of this expression is not transparent, and what appears to be the same basic idea is often
expressed in different ways, e.g. by saying that somebody ‘lacks reasonable alternatives’,
‘lacks acceptable alternatives’, or ‘lacks meaningful choices’. That said, rather than
attempt to clarify this idea, I will simply assume we have an adequate intuitive grasp on
it, since I will argue that it is the wrong way to approach these matters anyway.
Scholars working on consent have long recognized that lacking acceptable alternatives,
whatever exactly this means, does not in general invalidate somebody’s consent. 28 Con-
sider a simple example:
SURGERY: Patient needs surgery and will otherwise die. The surgery is safe,
effective, and relatively pain free. Patient consents to the surgery and Surgeon
performs it. 29
If anybody lacks acceptable alternatives, Patient surely does – his only alternative is death.
But this does not invalidate his consent, as his consent renders (or could render) the sur-
gery permissible. What follows if he does not consent is complicated. Given my stipulation
that the surgery is ‘safe, effective, and relatively pain free’, his refusal would arguably be
evidence of incompetence or misinformation, and would leave Surgeon with some inves-
tigative work to do. 30 But these details do not matter for our purposes; after disclosure, his
affirmative consent renders the surgery permissible (with no further investigations
needed), and a lack of acceptable alternatives thus does not invalidate his consent.
There are two interesting structural features of SURGERY: first, consenting presum-
ably is an acceptable alternative; second, the consent receiver is doing all they can to help
the consent provider. It is worth considering an example that lacks these features.
Consider:
RING: Seller needs money to pay for an urgent medical treatment. She believes
her only realistic way to get this money is to sell her late husband’s wedding ring,
which is quite valuable, but also of deep emotional significance. Seller locates
Buyer, receives fair market value for the ring, and is thus able to afford the
treatment.
Both options available to Seller are presumably unacceptable. Buyer also does less to help
than is possible (Buyer could give Seller the money outright). Does this render Seller’s
consent to sell her ring invalid? If it does, then Buyer violates Seller’s rights, as he takes

Consent and the Right to Privacy 9
Seller’s property without her valid consent. But Buyer surely does not violate Seller’s
rights here; he might be subject to other forms of criticism, but not this one. It follows that
Seller’s consent is valid, even though she lacks acceptable alternatives and even though
Buyer could but does not offer her one.
I believe people are sometimes misled about the significance of lacking acceptable alter-
natives because situations in which somebody lacks acceptable alternatives often (but not
always) have a separate feature which really does invalidate consent. Consider:
ROBBERY: Robber points a gun at Victim and says, ‘your money or your life’.
Victim hands over his money.
Victim lacks acceptable alternatives, and his consent is surely invalid. But notice another
feature of this example: Robber violates Victim’s rights by demanding his compliance
under the threat of murder, thus unjustly limiting the options Victim has available to
him (Victim should have a third option where he keeps his money and lives). Following
Wertheimer’s analysis, I believe this rights violation is what undermines Victim’s consent,
not a lack of acceptable alternatives. 31 Consider another example:
COFFEE: Bully grabs Innocent’s coffee and says, ‘give me a dollar or I’m keep-
ing this’. Innocent prefers not to lose her coffee and hands over a dollar.
Innocent’s consent is clearly invalid; this is not a legitimate transfer of property and her
dollar should be returned to her. That said, if we set aside the rights violation, Innocent’s
options are surely both acceptable; whether she loses her coffee or a dollar, she is at worst
mildly inconvenienced. The common feature that invalidates consent in ROBBERY and
COFFEE is thus not the mere absence of acceptable alternatives, but the presence of a spe-
cific sort of rights violation: Victim and Innocent each have a right to a third alternative
they are unjustly denied, and indeed, they are unjustly denied by the very party soliciting
their consent. This hypothesis also explains why Seller’s consent is valid in RING; it would
be very nice for Buyer to simply give Seller the money, but Seller has no right that Buyer
do this.
This is, at any rate, how I analyze these cases. That said, sorting out exactly when and
why various features of scenarios in which somebody lacks acceptable alternatives invali-
date their consent is a task I cannot properly undertake here; this is a lengthy dialectic that
invites iterative moves and countermoves. Fortunately, we do not need a perfectly general
solution to this (if there even is one to be found). This much is beyond dispute: lacking
acceptable alternatives does not in general invalidate somebody’s consent. So, what is it
about the specific lack of acceptable alternatives to data practices that is thought so
problematic?
I believe there is a straightforward answer here. Assume for sake of argument that for-
going certain technologies really is an ‘unacceptable alternative’, in whatever precise sense
you like. Assume also, as is currently true, that people must consent to some agreement to
access these technologies. Consent to this agreement is not necessarily invalid. For exam-
ple, if the agreement simply required users to pay some modest and reasonable fee to the
service provider, most users would surely have no grounds for complaint. The mere fact
that users lack acceptable alternatives is thus not itself a problem here. But of course, as
matters stand, this is not the agreement; users are instead required to accept invasive data
practices. Why is this a problem when paying a modest and reasonable fee would not be? I
propose that the most plausible answer is that this specific arrangement violates people’s

rights, not because they lack acceptable alternatives in the abstract, but because they lack a
specific alternative that, by right, should be available to them: one in which they both have
access to important technologies and maintain reasonable privacy. Call this ‘the access
right’. I believe the best version of the ‘no acceptable alternatives’ argument charges (cer-
tain) data practices with violating the access right.
Do members of our society have such a right? I find it quite plausible that they do, as
long as we are sufficiently flexible about what counts as ‘reasonable privacy’. But therein
lies the rub. It has long been recognized in the literature on the right to privacy that people
do not have a right to absolute privacy; they have a right to reasonable privacy, and what
counts as reasonable privacy is determined by balancing people’s privacy interests against
those various interests of others with which they conflict. 32 But this means we have essen-
tially reached the same point here that we did when considering information. The scope
and limits of the access right, assuming it is a genuine right at all, depend on the indepen-
dent justifications that can be offered for and against various data practices. Insofar as
these practices are independently justified, they fall outside the scope of the access right,
and the access right thus cannot be cited as invalidating user consent to them.
I should mention briefly that there is another way of reading the ‘no choice’ argument
according to which the claim is not that consent is invalidated, but simply that consent
is rendered pointless. For reasons discussed in the last section, I believe this argument is
also unsuccessful; insofar as users can bring meaningful preferences to bear on consent
decisions about data practices, and insofar as they have options that variously (even if
imperfectly) conform to these preferences, their consent is not pointless. Note also that
these conditions need not be satisfied in every case; a policy for soliciting user consent is
(minimally) not pointless if users can meaningfully exercise their discretion in some cases,
even if they cannot do so for all of them.
4. Externalities
In the space that remains, I wish to briefly say something about the second objection to
notice-and-consent, which targets its presupposition that data restrictions are imposed
almost exclusively for the protection of individual users. Against this, as Susser says, many
critics have argued that ‘... what is at issue in [data practices] is often a social rather than
individual interest. In such cases individuals should not be deciding about it in the first
place’. 33
The point that data practices can affect third-party interests, including perhaps broad
social interests, is well taken. Here are three examples. First, at an individual level, the col-
lection and use of one person’s data can facilitate inferences about nonconsenting third
parties, thus potentially undermining their privacy. For example, if enough people volun-
tarily disclose their sexual orientations, this might facilitate reliable inferences about the
sexual orientations of people who did not (and do not want to) reveal this. Second, this
time at a broader social level, there may be important values – like autonomy and freedom
of speech – that mass surveillance is inimical to. For example, Richards (2013) argues that
a society in which everybody’s research habits (e.g. search histories) are constantly mon-
itored may be one in which people are driven to intellectual conformity. Finally, mass sur-
veillance may lead to dangerous amalgamations of power in various entities, private and

public. For example, Richards also argues that mass surveillance can facilitate blackmail,
discrimination, manipulation, and the selective enforcement of laws. 34
I do not dispute the importance of these arguments, although I worry about some of the
details. I do, however, dispute the claim that individuals should automatically be disabled
from making some decision merely because it affects third-party interests (whether of
other individuals or of society generally). Our decisions, involving consent or otherwise,
very frequently affect third-party interests, e.g. when I host a dinner party and thus subject
my neighbors to increased noise. Sometimes this is legitimate and sometimes it is not, but
the mere observation that an interest has been set back does not by itself make the case.
This is true even for broad social interests, especially when these interests are affected
not by unilateral decree, but in an emergent way from the decisions of various individuals.
For example, the ubiquity of cell phones is transforming society in many ways, some big,
some small, and not all of them good (consider e.g. how the persistent availability of cell
phones transforms work culture). But this does not mean that people should be prohibited
from purchasing or using cell phones. Society is comprised of its members, and their deci-
sions can have cumulative implications for social values without any impropriety.
It might be helpful to distinguish two possible justifications for consent here: first, an
individual’s consent is solicited to legitimate the effects something has on third-party
interests; and second, an individual’s consent is solicited to legitimate something, and that
thing affects third-party interests.
The second style of justification is extremely common and not at all improper. To apply
this to the present context, assume certain data practices conflict with certain social
values, e.g. because they facilitate reliable inferences about the sensitive information of
nonconsenting third parties. This is only part of the justificatory story; we must also con-
sider any values these data practices facilitate, both to the individuals who participate, and
(potentially) to society generally. If these are significant enough – e.g. if they make impor-
tant technologies significantly better – then it may well be worth permitting these data
practices, costs to other values notwithstanding. Assuming they should be permitted,
the only question that remains is whose consent, if anybody’s, should be required to legit-
imate them. If these practices rely on extensive data collection, there is a strong case to be
made, on grounds of both legitimacy and desirability, that the people whose data is
employed should at least be included here. There is thus nothing absurd in requiring indi-
vidual consent for something that affects social values, at least if the purpose of consent is
not to justify these effects but is instead to legitimate something that has them as a
consequence.
Note also that the first style of justification may sometimes be valid as well, precisely for
broad social values, especially those pertaining to privacy. To focus on the matter at hand,
many of our privacy norms are essentially a series of informally negotiated boundaries that
demarcate certain conventional zones of privacy. 35 I do not mean to suggest that privacy is
arbitrary, or valuable only in some sort of relativistic sense. But I do mean to suggest that
the precise contours of our privacy norms are to some extent conventional, and insofar as
they are, it is legitimate for society, especially as a collective enterprise, to redraw them.
Individuals systematically choosing to waive entitlements that fall within this zone may
be one legitimate mechanism for doing this. I do not want to overstate the case here, as this
process can go awry for various reasons (especially when people have weak information)
and its powers of legitimation are not unlimited. But it is another respect in which broad

social values are not in principle beyond the legitimate purview of individual consent
decisions.
5. Conclusion
I conclude that user consent to data practices is in principle considerably more robust, and
more important, than the standard criticisms of notice-and-consent suggest. This does
not mean that notice-and-consent makes for good data policy; data subjects are vulnerable
to exploitation, and there are good reasons to suspect they have been (and will continue to
be) taken advantage of absent substantive legislation that protects them (although there
are also some reasons for optimism). What it does mean is that user consent can, in the
right circumstances, legitimate data practices which would otherwise be illegitimate –
even complicated ones which are extremely costly to avoid. It also means that user consent
must be solicited if such practices are to be deployed legitimately (and to reiterate, there
are sometimes good reasons that favor doing so). It is thus important that our data policies
continue to emphasize user consent, although exactly what this should look like
(e.g. which auxiliary protections should also be implemented and how significantly these
should deviate from the current system) is not a matter I have explored here.36
